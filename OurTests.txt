- For the BeforeClass method i decided to go with it since it seemed like the faster method for setting up.
- For testLegend i used my rooms map and get the size of it since the number of keys should be the same as
our legend size.
- Nothing much for testing size.
- For testing the four directions i just opened my excel sheet and looked for some doors that were close
together.
- For number of doors i wanted to loop through our Board board's board cells so i used the iterate over method
of the for loop and from there i was able to find the number of doors.
- Initial check i used somewhat random values spread out accross the board.
